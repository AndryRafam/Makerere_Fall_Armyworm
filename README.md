# Makerere_Fall_Armyworm
This project has been inspired by the following challenge: https://zindi.africa/competitions/makerere-fall-armyworm-crop-challenge. This experiment has two purpose:
  -1) To see, how well a CNN model built from scracth performs against a pretrained models (after being fine tuned) such as VGG16 / VGG19, ResNet50 ...
  -2) To see, how each pretrained models perform against each other on the dataset.
  

### Scratch model over 20 epochs:
  - Accuracy: 93.19 %
  - Loss: 20.19%

### VGG19 Fine Tuned over 5 epochs:
  - Accurayc: 98.76 %
  - Loss: 3.12 %
